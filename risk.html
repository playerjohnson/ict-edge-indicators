<h2>Trading Risk</h2><p>Trading foreign exchange, contracts for difference (CFDs), cryptocurrencies, futures and other leveraged products carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors. You could lose more than your initial deposit. Before deciding to trade, carefully consider your investment objectives, experience level and risk tolerance.</p>
<h2>No Financial Advice</h2><p>ICT Edge Indicators is a software tool provider. Nothing on this website or in our indicators constitutes financial, investment or trading advice. We do not provide signals, recommendations or personalised guidance. We are not registered financial advisors, investment advisors, or broker-dealers in any jurisdiction.</p>
<h2>No Performance Guarantees</h2><p>Our indicators identify technical patterns based on price data. The presence of a pattern (order block, fair value gap, etc.) does not guarantee that price will react as expected. Past patterns are not predictive of future price movements. No indicator, strategy or methodology can guarantee profits or eliminate the risk of loss.</p>
<h2>Past Performance</h2><p>Any examples, backtests, hypothetical results or demonstrations shown on this website or in our marketing materials are for educational purposes only. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Backtested results have inherent limitations and do not reflect actual trading conditions.</p>
<h2>Your Responsibility</h2><p>You are solely responsible for your trading decisions. By using our indicators, you acknowledge that you understand the risks of trading and that ICT Edge Indicators is not responsible for any losses you may incur. Always use proper risk management, never risk more than you can afford to lose, and consider seeking advice from a qualified financial professional.</p>
<h2>Regulatory Notice</h2><p>ICT Edge Indicators is not regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) or any other financial regulatory body. Our products are software tools, not regulated financial instruments.</p>
