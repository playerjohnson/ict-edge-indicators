        <h2>The Number One Rule</h2>
        <p>If you take one thing from ICT methodology, it should be this: trade in the direction of the higher timeframe. Counter-trend trading on the lower timeframe while the higher timeframe is trending is the single most common reason ICT traders fail. The HTF trend will override your 5-minute order block every time.</p>
        <p>Higher timeframe bias isn't a suggestion — it's a filter. Before you even open a lower timeframe chart, you need to know: is the HTF bullish, bearish, or ranging? Every trade you take should align with that answer.</p>

        <h2>Market Structure: BOS and MSS</h2>
        <p><strong>Break of Structure (BOS):</strong> When price takes out a swing high in an uptrend or a swing low in a downtrend, it confirms the existing trend direction. BOS is a continuation signal — the trend is intact.</p>
        <p><strong>Market Structure Shift (MSS):</strong> When price takes out a swing point against the prevailing trend — a swing low in an uptrend or a swing high in a downtrend — it signals a potential reversal. MSS is the first warning that the institutional money may be changing direction.</p>
        <p>The key distinction: BOS confirms, MSS warns. A single MSS doesn't guarantee a reversal, but it means you should be cautious about continuing in the previous direction until the market proves otherwise.</p>

        <h2>Determining Your Daily Bias</h2>
        <p>Before each trading session, work through this hierarchy:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Weekly chart:</strong> What's the overall trend? Are we in a weekly dealing range or trending? Is price in premium or discount of the weekly range?</li>
            <li><strong>Daily chart:</strong> Is the daily making higher highs and higher lows (bullish) or the opposite? Was the most recent swing point a BOS or MSS?</li>
            <li><strong>4-Hour chart:</strong> Does 4H structure align with daily? If 4H is bearish while daily is bullish, be cautious — you may be in a pullback.</li>
            <li><strong>1-Hour chart:</strong> This is where you refine. If Weekly, Daily and 4H are all bullish, you're looking for 1H bullish setups during kill zones.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>When all timeframes agree, you have a high-conviction bias. When they disagree, reduce position size or sit out.</p>

        <h2>The Dealing Range</h2>
        <p>ICT's dealing range concept breaks every price swing into two halves: premium (the upper half) and discount (the lower half). Smart money buys in discount and sells in premium — it's that simple.</p>
        <p>Once you identify the current HTF dealing range (the most recent significant swing high and swing low), you can calculate equilibrium (the 50% level). Above equilibrium is premium territory, below is discount. Bullish entries in discount, bearish entries in premium — this is the premium/discount model that underpins all ICT trading.</p>

        <h2>Multi-Timeframe Alignment Levels</h2>
        <p>The most powerful setups occur when concepts from multiple timeframes converge at the same price level:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A daily order block that sits inside a weekly FVG</li>
            <li>A 4H FVG at the equilibrium of the daily dealing range</li>
            <li>A 1H order block at the CE of a 4H FVG during the NY kill zone</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each additional layer of confluence increases the probability of a reaction. This is why multi-timeframe analysis isn't optional — it's the core of finding high-probability setups.</p>

        <h2>Practical Workflow</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sunday evening:</strong> Mark weekly and daily levels, determine weekly bias, identify the dealing range</li>
            <li><strong>Before each session:</strong> Check 4H structure, note unmitigated OBs and FVGs, confirm or update bias</li>
            <li><strong>During kill zones:</strong> Drop to 15m/5m, find setups aligned with your established HTF bias</li>
            <li><strong>After the session:</strong> Review whether the day confirmed or shifted the bias for tomorrow</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When Bias Is Unclear</h2>
        <p>Sometimes the HTF is genuinely ranging — no clear BOS in either direction, price oscillating between defined highs and lows. In these conditions, you have two options: trade the range extremes (buy at the range low, sell at the range high) or simply don't trade until a directional bias emerges. The second option is often the more profitable one.</p>
