        <h2>What Is a Fair Value Gap?</h2>
        <p>A fair value gap (FVG) is a three-candle pattern where the middle candle is so large that a gap is left between the wicks of the first and third candles. In other words, there's a price range that only one candle traded through — creating an "imbalance" where buyers and sellers didn't properly exchange at every price level.</p>
        <p>In ICT terminology, this imbalance represents inefficient price delivery. The market tends to return to these areas to "rebalance" — giving both sides of the market an opportunity to participate at those prices. This is why FVGs act as magnets for price.</p>

        <h2>Bullish vs Bearish FVGs</h2>
        <p><strong>Bullish FVG:</strong> Occurs during an upward move. The gap exists between the high of candle 1 and the low of candle 3 (with candle 2 being the large bullish displacement candle). Price tends to return downward to fill this gap before continuing higher.</p>
        <p><strong>Bearish FVG:</strong> Occurs during a downward move. The gap exists between the low of candle 1 and the high of candle 3. Price tends to return upward to fill this gap before continuing lower.</p>

        <h2>Why Price Returns to FVGs</h2>
        <p>The institutional explanation: when large players drive price impulsively, they can't fill their entire position at one price. The FVG represents price levels where their orders weren't fully matched. The market returns to these levels to complete the order matching process — "rebalancing" the imbalance.</p>
        <p>In practical terms, FVGs work because they represent areas of genuine institutional interest, and the market has a well-documented tendency to fill gaps and imbalances before continuing in the prevailing direction.</p>

        <h2>Consequent Encroachment (CE)</h2>
        <p>Consequent encroachment is the midpoint (50%) of a fair value gap. In ICT methodology, CE is often the most precise entry point within an FVG. Rather than entering at the edge of the gap, waiting for price to reach the CE level can provide a better risk-to-reward ratio.</p>
        <p>The logic: if price enters the FVG and reaches the midpoint, the gap is being respected — institutions are defending it. If price pushes significantly past CE, the gap may be invalidating rather than filling. CE gives you a clear decision point.</p>

        <h2>Types of Imbalances</h2>
        <p>The ICT framework identifies several types of imbalance beyond the standard FVG:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fair Value Gap (FVG)</strong> — the classic 3-candle imbalance where wicks don't overlap</li>
            <li><strong>Volume Imbalance</strong> — a gap between two candle bodies (not wicks) where volume was delivered on only one side</li>
            <li><strong>Price Imbalance</strong> — also called an opening gap, where one candle's open doesn't overlap with the previous candle's close</li>
            <li><strong>NWOG/NDOG</strong> — New Week Opening Gaps and New Day Opening Gaps are institutional-timeframe imbalances between sessions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Trading FVGs: A Practical Model</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Identify the HTF bias</strong> — trade bullish FVGs in a bullish trend, bearish FVGs in a bearish trend</li>
            <li><strong>Find displacement</strong> — look for FVGs created by impulsive moves that break structure</li>
            <li><strong>Wait for the retrace</strong> — let price come back to the FVG rather than chasing the initial move</li>
            <li><strong>Enter at CE or OB within the FVG</strong> — if there's an order block inside the FVG, that's a high-confluence entry</li>
            <li><strong>Stop beyond the FVG boundary</strong> — if price fully violates the gap, the thesis is invalidated</li>
            <li><strong>Target the opposing liquidity</strong> — the swing high/low or external liquidity pool that price is being drawn toward</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>FVG + Order Block Confluence</h2>
        <p>The most powerful ICT setup occurs when an order block sits inside a fair value gap. This means you have both a zone of institutional accumulation (OB) and an area of inefficient price delivery (FVG) at the same level. When price returns to this confluent zone, the probability of a reaction is significantly higher than either concept alone.</p>
        <p>This is why a confluence-based approach — combining multiple ICT concepts at the same level — outperforms trading any single concept in isolation.</p>

        <h2>Common FVG Mistakes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Trading every FVG</strong> — only FVGs created by true displacement (structure-breaking moves) are worth trading</li>
            <li><strong>Ignoring the premium/discount model</strong> — bullish FVGs in premium are low probability; bearish FVGs in discount are low probability</li>
            <li><strong>Not tracking fill status</strong> — once an FVG is completely filled, it's no longer a valid zone</li>
            <li><strong>Forgetting time context</strong> — FVGs formed during kill zones carry more weight than those formed during low-volume periods</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Enter an FVG Trade</h2>
        <p>The textbook FVG entry is straightforward: wait for price to retrace into the gap, enter at the CE (50% midpoint), and place a stop beyond the opposite edge of the FVG. If you're trading a bullish FVG, price drops back into the zone, you enter at the CE with a stop below the FVG low. Target is the swing high that created the displacement, or external liquidity beyond it.</p>
        <p>In practice there are refinements worth applying. First, not all retracements into an FVG are equal. A slow, grinding retrace is less convincing than a sharp, impulsive retrace that reaches CE and immediately shows rejection. On a 5-minute chart, a lower timeframe (1-minute) BOS at the CE level gives an additional confirmation trigger before committing size.</p>
        <p>Second, the FVG's position within the larger range matters. A bullish FVG that forms in the discount half of the HTF dealing range is a higher-probability setup than one forming in premium. ICT methodology calls this alignment between the entry zone and the macro range position — buying in discount, selling in premium. FVGs that form in the wrong half of the range should be traded with reduced size or skipped entirely.</p>
        <p>Third, watch for what happens when price enters the FVG. A strong rejection at CE with minimal penetration below suggests the zone is being respected. Price drilling through CE and approaching the far edge of the FVG is a warning — the zone may be about to be invalidated. The far edge of the FVG is typically your hard stop; any close beyond it invalidates the imbalance thesis.</p>

        <h2>FVGs on Different Timeframes</h2>
        <p>FVGs exist at every timeframe and carry different significance depending on their source. A weekly FVG represents an imbalance at the institutional timeframe — it may take weeks or months to fill, but when price trades into it, the reaction is often powerful and persistent. A 1-minute FVG is noise for most traders but can be valuable for scalpers refining entries within larger-timeframe setups.</p>
        <p>The most useful framing is hierarchical. On a top-down analysis approach, a 4H FVG defines the macro entry zone for the week. A 1H FVG narrows the entry zone within the 4H structure. A 15-minute FVG gives the precise entry price. Each successive timeframe's FVG is relevant only if it sits within — or closely aligns with — the FVG from the timeframe above it.</p>
        <p>When a 1H FVG and a 4H FVG overlap, the overlapping region is the highest-priority entry zone. Price entering this confluent area has two timeframes of institutional interest stacked at the same level — the probability of a meaningful reaction increases substantially.</p>

        <h2>What Invalidates an FVG</h2>
        <p>An FVG is considered invalidated when price closes fully through the gap — when a candle's closing price moves past the far boundary of the FVG. A wick into the zone is not invalidation; wicks represent temporary probing of liquidity. A close through the zone means the imbalance has been consumed and the expected reaction didn't materialise.</p>
        <p>When an FVG is invalidated, re-evaluate the HTF structure rather than immediately looking for the next setup in the same direction. A filled and violated FVG often signals that the displacement that created it was a liquidity run rather than genuine institutional accumulation — meaning the trend may be weaker than it appeared.</p>
        <p>One nuance: partial fills. An FVG where price returns to the CE and leaves the lower portion unfilled is "partially mitigated." The unfilled lower portion remains a valid zone — on a subsequent retrace, price may react from the remaining gap. Track which portion of the gap has been visited and which hasn't; the unvisited portion is the live level.</p>

        <h2>FVGs vs Fair Value in Traditional Analysis</h2>
        <p>The term "fair value gap" sometimes causes confusion because traditional finance uses "fair value" to describe the theoretical intrinsic value of an asset. ICT's FVG concept is unrelated to that definition. In ICT terminology, the gap is "unfair" because it represents a price range where proper two-sided price discovery didn't occur — buyers and sellers didn't both participate at every price level within the gap. The market returning to fill the gap is the mechanism by which price delivers "fairly" — allowing both sides to transact at levels they couldn't access during the initial displacement.</p>
        <p>This is why FVGs have predictive value that traditional gap analysis in equities doesn't fully capture. Equity gap-fill statistics are real but operate on daily charts with overnight gaps. ICT FVGs operate on every timeframe and are driven by intraday institutional mechanics that equity gap studies don't address.</p>
