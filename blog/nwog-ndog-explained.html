        <h1>NWOG &amp; NDOG Explained — ICT Opening Gaps</h1>
        <p class="blog-intro">New Week Opening Gaps and New Day Opening Gaps are among the most reliably predictive concepts in ICT methodology. Markets have a strong tendency to fill these gaps — and the 50% level is one of the cleanest entries in the entire playbook. Here's everything you need to know.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="blog-content">
        <h2>What Is a New Week Opening Gap (NWOG)?</h2>
        <p>A New Week Opening Gap is the price range between Friday's close and Sunday's open in forex markets. When markets close on Friday evening and reopen Sunday evening, there is often a gap — a price range that was never traded. This gap appears on your chart as empty space between two candles.</p>
        <p>The gap can be bullish (Sunday opens above Friday's close, implying upward institutional positioning over the weekend) or bearish (Sunday opens below Friday's close, implying downward pressure). The direction of the gap gives you an initial bias read for the week — though this is one input, not a trading signal on its own.</p>
        <p>NWOGs are most relevant on forex pairs, where markets physically close for the weekend. They also appear on cryptocurrency markets that have lower weekend liquidity. Traditional indices (US30, NAS100) don't produce NWOGs in the same way because they have overnight sessions, but cryptocurrency indices and weekend-traded instruments do.</p>

        <h2>What Is a New Day Opening Gap (NDOG)?</h2>
        <p>A New Day Opening Gap is the same concept applied at the daily level — the gap between yesterday's close and today's open. NDOGs appear on all markets: forex, indices, crypto, and commodities. They're particularly prominent on indices like the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq, which gap overnight between the US equity close and the next day's pre-market open.</p>
        <p>NDOGs are smaller than NWOGs on average, but they're also more frequent. On active index markets, there may be an NDOG on three or four out of five trading days in any given week. Each represents an unfilled imbalance — a price range that institutions skipped over and that the market will tend to revisit.</p>

        <h2>Why Does Price Fill Opening Gaps?</h2>
        <p>The institutional logic behind gap filling is rooted in how large participants manage positions. When price gaps at the open, it means that anyone who wanted to transact at the gap levels during the closed period couldn't. This creates two related dynamics:</p>
        <p>First, unfilled limit orders. Institutions often place limit orders at price levels they expect to be reached. If a gap moves price past those levels, the orders weren't filled — and the institution still wants to transact at those prices. This creates a gravitational pull back toward the gap.</p>
        <p>Second, liquidity. The gap itself represents a price range with no volume profile — no one transacted there. Markets tend to revisit areas of thin liquidity to facilitate the orders that couldn't be filled on the way through. This is the same logic that drives price to fill Fair Value Gaps — gaps are imbalances, and imbalances tend to be corrected.</p>
        <p>The fill rate for NWOGs on major forex pairs is historically very high. Studies of EUR/USD and GBP/USD show that the majority of weekly opening gaps are at least partially filled within the same trading week. NDOGs on indices have similarly high fill rates, particularly within the first two hours of the trading session.</p>

        <h2>Consequent Encroachment — The Precision Level</h2>
        <p>The 50% midpoint of any opening gap is called the Consequent Encroachment (CE) in ICT methodology. It's one of the most important levels within the gap for two reasons.</p>
        <p>The first reason is that the CE represents the mathematical midpoint of the imbalance. In ICT theory, price filling to the 50% level "encroaches" on the gap — delivering partially into the unfilled range. This partial fill is often sufficient to trigger a reaction, particularly when the CE aligns with other ICT reference levels (order blocks, FVGs, session opens).</p>
        <p>The second reason is practical: the CE gives you a precise entry level with a definable stop. If you're trading a fill of a bullish NWOG, you might enter at the CE with a stop below the full gap low. If the gap fills to CE and reverses, you've achieved a clean R:R entry. If it continues to the full gap close, you've simply been stopped out — the trade was wrong, not the concept.</p>

        <h2>How to Identify NWOGs and NDOGs Manually</h2>
        <p>To identify a NWOG manually on a forex chart, switch to a 4H or 1H chart and look at the candle transition between the last candle on Friday and the first candle on Sunday. If there's a gap between the Friday close (the closing price of the last Friday candle) and the Sunday open (the opening price of the first Sunday candle), that's your NWOG. The gap zone is from the Friday close to the Sunday open.</p>
        <p>For NWOGs, you can also check the daily chart — the gap appears between the Friday daily candle close and the Monday daily candle open (since Sunday candles are often combined into the Monday daily bar on most brokers). The range is the same.</p>
        <p>For NDOGs on indices, look at daily charts or 1H charts. The gap appears between the previous day's close (regular trading hours close) and the next day's open (the first printed price of the regular session). On a 1H chart, this is typically the gap between the 4 PM candle and the 9:30 AM candle the following day.</p>

        <h2>Trading NWOGs and NDOGs — The ICT Approach</h2>
        <p>Opening gaps are reference levels, not standalone trade signals. The ICT approach is to use them as part of a top-down analysis framework rather than entering blindly when price reaches a gap.</p>

        <h3>Step 1: Mark the Gap at the Weekly Open</h3>
        <p>At the start of each week (Sunday evening for forex traders), mark the NWOG on your chart. Note whether it's bullish or bearish, and mark the CE level. This becomes a target for the week — a level you expect price to visit, though timing and direction of approach will vary.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Identify the Directional Bias</h3>
        <p>Use your Higher Timeframe Bias to determine whether you're bullish or bearish on the pair this week. A bullish NWOG in a bullish HTF structure is a potential support level — price may gap up, pull back to fill the gap (or reach CE), and continue higher. A bearish NWOG in a bullish structure is a weaker setup — the gap may simply get filled and invalidated.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Wait for Confluence at the Gap</h3>
        <p>Don't enter at the gap simply because price is approaching it. Wait for additional confluence:</p>
        <p>The highest-quality NWOG entries occur when the gap zone also contains an Order Block or Fair Value Gap. When price reaches a NWOG CE that is inside a bullish order block, and this occurs during a kill zone (London or NY open), you have three layers of ICT confluence — that's a high-conviction setup. Using the Confluence Suite, this would score 3–4 on the confluence scale, which is the threshold for a tradeable setup.</p>

        <h3>Step 4: Manage Risk at the Gap Boundaries</h3>
        <p>The natural stop placement for a NWOG trade is below the gap low (for bullish entries) or above the gap high (for bearish entries). A move through the full gap without reversal suggests the imbalance is being run through rather than reacted to — the thesis is wrong, and a clean stop is below/above the gap boundary.</p>

        <h2>Common Mistakes With Opening Gaps</h2>
        <p>The most common mistake is treating opening gaps as guaranteed fills on the same day. They're not. A NWOG may take until Wednesday or Thursday to fill. NDOGs on indices may not fill until the following session or later. The tendency to fill is real, but the timeline is not fixed. Patience is required.</p>
        <p>The second common mistake is ignoring the direction of the gap relative to the larger trend. A bearish NWOG in a strongly bullish trending market is likely to be quickly filled and forgotten. A bullish NWOG in a corrective phase of a bullish trend is likely to provide strong support. Context determines how much weight to give any particular gap.</p>
        <p>The third mistake is entering at the gap without waiting for price action confirmation. Just because price reaches a NWOG CE doesn't mean you buy immediately. Wait for a lower timeframe signal: a bullish displacement, an FVG formation, or a clear rejection of the CE level on the entry timeframe before committing to the trade.</p>

        <h2>NWOGs vs. NDOGs — Which to Prioritise?</h2>
        <p>NWOGs carry more weight because they represent a larger time period of unfilled price action (the entire weekend). On major forex pairs, NWOGs that align with the weekly directional bias are the highest-quality weekly reference levels. They should be the first thing you mark at the weekly open.</p>
        <p>NDOGs are more frequent and therefore individually lower significance — but they're extremely useful for intraday index trading. On NAS100 and US30, a daily gap that forms overnight is often the primary target for the first 90 minutes of the regular session. Knowing where the NDOG is — and whether price is trading above or below it — gives you an immediate bias for the morning session.</p>
        <p>The practical approach: prioritise NWOGs for weekly bias and swing-level targets. Use NDOGs for intraday reference on indices and for shorter-term entries within the weekly framework.</p>
