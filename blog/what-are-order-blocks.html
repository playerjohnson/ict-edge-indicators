        <h2>The Institutional Logic Behind Order Blocks</h2>
        <p>An order block is the last candle of opposing colour before an impulsive price move. In ICT methodology, it represents the price range where institutions accumulated their positions before driving price aggressively in one direction. When price returns to this range, remaining institutional orders may still be resting there — making it a high-probability zone for a reaction.</p>
        <p>This isn't retail support and resistance. Order blocks identify where smart money positioned itself, using the specific candle footprint that institutional accumulation leaves behind.</p>

        <h2>Bullish Order Blocks</h2>
        <p>A bullish order block is the last bearish (down) candle before a strong bullish displacement. The logic: institutions were buying into selling pressure at this level. When price returns to this zone, remaining buy orders may still be waiting to be filled.</p>
        <p>To identify a valid bullish OB, look for a down candle (close below open) immediately followed by one or more strong bullish candles that break above a recent swing high or create displacement (a sharp move with little retracement). The entire range of that down candle — from its high to its low — is the order block zone.</p>
        <p><strong>Refinement:</strong> For more precise entries, many traders use only the body of the candle (open to close) rather than the full wick range. This narrows the zone and gives a better risk-to-reward ratio, though it increases the chance of price not quite reaching your entry.</p>

        <h2>Bearish Order Blocks</h2>
        <p>The mirror image: a bearish order block is the last bullish (up) candle before a strong bearish displacement. Institutions were selling into buying pressure. When price returns to this zone, remaining sell orders create a potential reaction.</p>
        <p>Look for an up candle followed by aggressive selling that breaks below a recent swing low. The range of that up candle is your bearish OB.</p>

        <h2>What Makes an Order Block Valid?</h2>
        <p>Not every down candle before an up move is a valid order block. Here's what separates high-probability OBs from noise:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Displacement must follow</strong> — the move away from the OB should be impulsive (large candles, minimal overlap, creating FVGs). A slow drift doesn't qualify.</li>
            <li><strong>Break of structure</strong> — the displacement should break a significant swing point. An OB that leads to a move that stays within the current range is weaker.</li>
            <li><strong>HTF alignment</strong> — bullish OBs in a bullish HTF trend are higher probability. Counter-trend OBs are riskier.</li>
            <li><strong>Premium/discount context</strong> — bullish OBs in discount (below equilibrium) are stronger. Bearish OBs in premium (above equilibrium) are stronger.</li>
            <li><strong>Unmitigated</strong> — an OB that price hasn't returned to yet is "unmitigated" and more likely to produce a reaction on first touch.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Mitigation: When OBs Are "Used Up"</h2>
        <p>When price returns to an order block and reacts, those resting institutional orders get filled — the OB is "mitigated." A fully mitigated OB is less likely to produce another reaction because the orders have been absorbed.</p>
        <p>Partial mitigation occurs when price only touches the edge of the OB. The remaining unfilled portion may still produce a reaction on a future visit. Tracking mitigation status is crucial for knowing which zones are still "live."</p>

        <h2>Breaker Blocks: When Order Blocks Fail</h2>
        <p>When price violates an order block entirely — moving through it without a reaction — it becomes a "breaker block." This is a powerful concept: the zone that was supposed to hold now becomes a level that price may react from in the opposite direction.</p>
        <p>For example, if a bullish OB fails and price drives below it, that former bullish OB becomes a bearish breaker. When price returns to it from below, it may now act as resistance. The logic: the institutions whose buy orders were there have been stopped out, and new participants may now be positioned in the opposite direction.</p>

        <h2>Trading Order Blocks: Practical Framework</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Determine HTF bias</strong> — are you looking for longs or shorts today?</li>
            <li><strong>Identify unmitigated OBs</strong> aligned with your bias on the 15m-1H chart</li>
            <li><strong>Wait for price to return to the OB during a kill zone</strong> (London or NY session)</li>
            <li><strong>Look for lower timeframe confirmation</strong> — a market structure shift on the 1m-5m chart within the OB zone</li>
            <li><strong>Enter with a stop below/above the OB</strong> (or the refined body range)</li>
            <li><strong>Target the opposing liquidity pool</strong> — the swing high/low that price is likely being drawn to</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Trading every OB</strong> — without HTF context, you'll trade against the flow and get chopped up</li>
            <li><strong>Ignoring displacement quality</strong> — a weak move after the OB candle means weak institutional interest</li>
            <li><strong>Not tracking mitigation</strong> — revisiting already-mitigated OBs leads to false expectations</li>
            <li><strong>Using OBs in isolation</strong> — they're most powerful combined with FVGs, session timing and liquidity targets</li>
        </ul>
