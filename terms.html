<div class="blog-article-hero"><h1>Terms of Service</h1><p class="meta">Effective: 14 February 2026</p></div>
<article class="blog-article">
<h2>Service Description</h2><p>ICT Edge Indicators provides TradingView indicators delivered as Pine Script invite-only scripts. Your subscription grants you personal, non-transferable access to the indicators included in your plan tier for as long as your subscription is active.</p>
<h2>Subscriptions</h2><p>Subscriptions are billed monthly or annually. You can cancel at any time; access continues until the end of your current billing period. Annual subscribers may request a prorated refund within 30 days of purchase. No refunds on monthly plans once the billing cycle has begun.</p>
<h2>Acceptable Use</h2><p>You may not share your TradingView access with others, redistribute our indicator code, attempt to decompile or reverse-engineer the Pine Scripts, or use the indicators in any automated trading system for commercial resale.</p>
<h2>No Trading Advice</h2><p>ICT Edge Indicators provides tools, not financial advice. We are not registered financial advisors. All trading decisions are yours. See our Risk Disclaimer for full details.</p>
<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2><p>We provide indicators on an "as is" basis. We make no guarantees about trading performance. We are not liable for any losses incurred from using our tools. Our total liability is limited to the fees you have paid in the most recent billing period.</p>
<h2>Modifications</h2><p>We may update these terms at any time. Continued use of the service after changes constitutes acceptance. We will notify subscribers of material changes via email.</p>
<h2>Governing Law</h2><p>These terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales.</p>
